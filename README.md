This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

    The standard rules (pulled from Wikipedia):
    1. Any live cell with less than two live neighbors
       dies.
    2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors
       lives.
    3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors
       dies.
    4. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes
       a live cell.

    This adaptation prompts the user to enter an integer
    between 1 and 100. This will populate the board with
    gliders and blocks. The user must press enter to
    display the next generation or enter the letter 'Q' 
    to terminate the program.
